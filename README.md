# nba_api_intro
My introduction to nba_api, an api found here: https://github.com/swar/nba_api. 

Part 1 will explain the most basic functionality.

Part 2 explains how to use the players module for game log data. 

Part 3 shows how to use that data to create a plot using that data for a user-specified player.
