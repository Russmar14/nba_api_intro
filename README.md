# nba_api_intro
### My introduction to nba_api, an api found here: https://github.com/swar/nba_api. 

* Part 1 will explain the most basic functionality.

* Part 2 explains how to use the  `players` module for game log data. 

* Part 3 shows how to use that data to create a plot using that data for a user-specified player.

* Part 4 shows how to use the `teams` module and allows a user to pick a team to compare win/loss record for vs each opponent it's faced.

* Part 5 uses team game results from the `leaguegamefinder` module and its class to call box score stats for teams, then shows how to build a logistic regression model using `sklearn`.
